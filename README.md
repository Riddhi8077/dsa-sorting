# Data Structures & Algorithms – Structured Practice Repository

This repository documents my disciplined practice of Data Structures and Algorithms.  
It is not a random collection of solutions — it reflects structured learning, pattern recognition, and continuous improvement.

The focus is on understanding problem-solving techniques deeply and implementing them cleanly in C++.

---

## Purpose

- Strengthen core DSA fundamentals
- Master common interview patterns
- Build implementation clarity
- Develop consistency through daily practice
- Prepare for technical interviews and open-source contributions

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Sorting Algorithms (From Scratch)

Implemented manually without relying on built-in sorting:

- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  

Each implementation focuses on:
- Clean logic
- Time & space complexity understanding
- Proper function structuring

---

### 2. Trees

Key problems solved:

- Binary Tree Traversals  
- Validate Binary Search Tree  
- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree  
- Diameter of Binary Tree  
- Path Sum  
- Lowest Common Ancestor  
- Balanced Binary Tree  

Concepts practiced:

- Recursive tree traversal patterns  
- Postorder strategy for height-based problems  
- Divide-and-conquer reasoning  
- Optimized early termination techniques  

---

### 3. Recursion & Backtracking

Problems include:

- Subsets  
- Permutations  
- Combination Sum (I, II, III, IV)  

Core techniques learned:

- Include/Exclude decision modeling  
- Backtracking with state reversal  
- Recursive tree visualization  
- Controlled base-case design  

---

### 4. Graphs

Problems covered:

- DFS & BFS traversal  
- Number of Islands  
- Clone Graph  
- Path Existence in Graph  

Concepts practiced:

- Adjacency list representation  
- Grid-to-graph conversion  
- Visited tracking strategies  
- Recursive and iterative traversal  

---

### 5. Bit Manipulation

Problems:

- Single Number (XOR-based solution)  
- Reverse Bits  

Concepts:

- XOR cancellation properties  
- Bit masking  
- Left and right shifting  
- Constant space optimization  

---

## Learning Approach

- Solve problems on paper before coding (dry-run first approach)
- Focus on patterns rather than memorizing solutions
- Re-solve important problems to strengthen retention
- Maintain structured commits to reflect real progress
- Document insights after completing each topic

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- LeetCode-style problem structure

---

## What This Repository Represents

This repository represents:

- Consistency over intensity  
- Clarity over shortcuts  
- Depth over quantity  

The goal is not to collect solved problems, but to develop strong foundational thinking that scales to system design and real-world engineering challenges.

---

## Ongoing Progress

Upcoming areas of focus:

- Advanced Graph Algorithms  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Sliding Window & Two-Pointer Patterns  
- System Design Foundations  

This repository will continue evolving as my understanding deepens.
